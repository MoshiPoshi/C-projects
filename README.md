# C-projects
This is a repository of my C projects, demonstrating a range of skills from basic data structures to more complex systems programming tasks. You'll find well-documented projects like a calculator, a game, a chat server, and more. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, there's something here for everyone.
