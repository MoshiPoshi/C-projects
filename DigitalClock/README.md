# C Scientific Calculator

This is a simple C program that creates a clock that runs infinitely until the program is manually stopped. The clock is displayed in the format hh:mm:ss, where hh represents hours, mm represents minutes, and ss represents seconds.


## Prerequisites


To run this program, you will need a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC.

## Installation and Execution

1-Download the program's source code from a trusted source.

2-Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the source code is saved.

3-Compile the program using your C compiler. For example, using GCC, you can use the following command: `gcc clock.c -o clock.exe`

4-Run the program by typing its name in the terminal. For example: `clock.exe`

## Usage

Once the program is running, it will prompt you to enter the time you want to set for the clock. Enter the time in the format hh:mm:ss and press Enter.

The clock will then start running, and you will see the time displayed in the console window. The clock will update every second and will continue running indefinitely until you manually stop the program.
